##Who am I?

We cut immediately to the unanswerable questions, don't we? I can try to field this in terms of things I do, I suppose. 

I'm some sort of nerd. Hobbies include:

+ Linux/Gnu Hurd
+ Science
+ Programming
+ Comics
+ Science fiction/Fantasy
+ Tabletop Gaming
+ Dota 2
+ Solving everything with the power of random numbers
+ Hating technology, the very source of my powers
+ Space

This list probably will grow forever. 


I'm currently a masters student at Stony Brook University, studying physics. I currently work in computational condensed matter. I'm hoping to graduate in August, and I'm looking to work on mathematical or physical modeling problems. This can include anything from working in data science to building multiphysics software, but I'm looking for challenging problems to attack with computers and math. [Don't email me with this stuff though][linkedin].

##Why a blog though?

Who knows? We'll see if this goes anywhere.
